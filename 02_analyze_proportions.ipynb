      "[Answer]Monica's mother ate half as many cookies as Monica's father, so she ate 10 cookies / 2 = 5 cookies. Monica's brother ate 5 cookies + 2 cookies = 7 cookies. There were 30 cookies - 7 cookies - 5 cookies - 10 cookies = 8 cookies left for Monica. The answer is 8.\n",
      "Q: Tim drops a ball off the roof of a 96-foot tall building. The ball bounces to half the height from which it fell on each bounce. How high will it bounce on the fifth bounce?\n",
      "A: On the first bounce, it will reach a height of 96 / 2 = 48 feet.] On the second bounce, it will reach a height of 48 / 2 = 24 feet. On the third bounce, it will reach a height of 24 / 2 = 12 feet. On the fourth bounce, it will reach a height of 12 / 2 = 6 feet. On the fifth bounce, it will reach a height of 6 / 2 = 3 feet. The answer is 3.\n",

      "[Question: Jeff bought 6 pairs of shoes and 4 jerseys for $560. Jerseys cost 1/4 price of one pair of shoes. Find the shoe's price total price.\n",
      "Answer: Step-by-step reasoning process: Let X be the shoe price. The jersey's price is 1 / 4 * X. Jeff bought 6 pairs of shoes and 4 jerseys for 6 * X + 4 * (1 / 4X) = $560. Multiplying through the parentheses produces 6X + X = $560. Combining like terms produces 7X = $560. Dividing both sides by 7 produces X = $80, so the shoe price is $80. Since Jeff bought 6 pairs of shoes, he spent 80 * 6 = $480 on shoes.\n",
      "So the answer is 480.\n",
